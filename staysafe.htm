	Here is a detailed explanation of how people die due to infection -:<br><br>
1)First the Virus enters your body by nose,mouth,eyes,etc.<br><br>
2)Human breathing system starts from nose and end in Alveoli(in lungs).Alveoli are site for exchange of gases(Oxygen and Carbon dioxide).<br><br>
3)The virus somehow travel through your windpipe and enter the cells of wall of Alveoli.It upload its RNA into the cell's nucleus which make the cell generates more copies of that virus.At some point the cell burst releasing many copies of virus which goes into more cell and make then burst.<br><br>
4)Bursting of cells makes pus which cover the site for exchange of gases.<br><br>
5)Advancded immune system already starts  acting to produce antibodies.<br><br>
6)Even if your immune system is strong,filling of pus in the alveoli becomes deadly.As it stops the exchange of gas and Oxygen level in your blood goes down.<br><br>
7)You can now understand the symptoms-Cough to take the pus out of alveoli,Breathing problems due to lack of oxygen,fever because your body is fighting.<br><br>
8)At last the person dies due to lack of Oxygen in his/her body.<br><br>
